Emotion Detecter is a flask based web application which detects emotions from text using AI. It utilizes a pre-trained 
emotion detection model to classify emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, and more. It works by a simple REST API 
to analyze emotions from text. unittest was also used for unit testing to ensure reliable emotion detection. The project 
was a part of a course I completed on Coursera.
